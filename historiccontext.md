### Overall Context

Historians have produced several studies on the transition in workplace safety culture at the beginning of the 20th Century and the legislative, legal, and social pressures that shifted the view of workplace accidents from something that were an inevitable byproduct of dangerous work to a failure of management initiatives. As the country industrialized throughout the 1800s new machinery and processes were introduced that made workplaces increasingly dangerous. Government commissions began to examine safety within certain industries, and attention was brought to the legal framework of accident compensation. In 1900-1910 states began to enact worker's compensation laws, which required employers to compensate workers or their families for injury or death on the job regardless of fault, streamlining the compensation process for both worker and employer. This led to the increasing presence of safety programs within the workplace to reduce accidents as part of management procedure. Some industries, particularly manufacturing, were quicker to implement safety programs than others. There is also substantial historical research on the emergence of environmental awareness and advocacy in the same time period. Environmental regulations were slower to develop than safety legislation, with the first federal protective legislation not enacted until the 1940s. However, the first conservation groups were established in the late 1800s, and an early battle in the environmental movement involved stopping stone quarrying activities along the Palisades in New Jersey and the creation of the Palisades Interstate Park in 1909.
 
Most previous studies around changing workplace safety standards with an industry rather than regulatory focus have investigated the mining and railroad industries which were exceptionally dangerous workplaces in the 1800s. Other historians have studied the history of factory safety programs after the 1910s where there was an immediate measurable change to procedures. Several environmental histories have been written that focus on the mining industry. The work of stone quarrying incorporates many of the same dangers (falling stone, heights, use of explosives, health concerns from silica inhalation) that have been studied by historians of mining, but also includes a factory component as the stone finishing process requires blocks of stone to be shaped by increasingly complex machinery in finishing shops. As these shops were largely owned by the same companies doing the quarrying they are an integral part of the stone industry. Quarrying has never been as important an industry as mining to the government, so there is less direct regulatory history than there is for mining. The stone industry overall is little studied outside small regional histories of places where stone is located. However, it's an industry with an enormous impact on the built environment we live in, and its double role in both resource extraction and factory work makes it particularly interesting in terms of how its own safety processes were developed and spoken about. In my own investigations I have found almost no previous work on the history of quarry safety standards and very little work related to the quarry industry within the context of environmental studies.

### The Stone Quarrying Industry 1888-1920

*Add information here about quarry work in the 1880s-1920s.*

One publication for this industry was Stone: An Illustrated Magazine, which billed itself "A Journal For Producers, Workers and Users of Stone, Marble and Granite".  First published in 1888 by the D.H. Ranck Publishing Co., the monthly journal featured a mix of articles about stone markets and new quarry locations, technical information about stone types and machinery, and notes on new projects requiring stone and pertinent legislation. In addition each issue was filled with advertisements for stone quarrying equipment, provided a list of upcoming contracts involving stone to inform subscribers of potential work, provided an updated list of stone prices, and contained general quarry news items and a “for sale/help wanted” section.

### Topics and Themes of Analysis

I used basic text analysis techniques to study language around hazards, safety, health, and environmental issues. I wanted to look and see if overall patterns of language around certain keywords changed before and after 1910 when state workers' compensation laws became common. I hoped that by using a variety of techniques that I might be able to see general trends to guide my research in these areas. My final investigations for this project use the following methods of text analysis: 
 
- **Word frequency over time:** To look at words associated with safety, health, and environmental issues and how their use changes in the journal over time.
*[Results for this method can be found here](https://alsven.github.io/reswordfreq/)*
 
- **Key words in context:** To determine where words associated with safety, health, and environmental issues appear within the journal and what they are being used to discuss.
*[Results for this method can be found here](https://alsven.github.io/reskeywords/)*
 
- **Word vector analysis:** To examine groups of words to see what additional words are used in semantically similar contexts to obtain a broader picture of how issues were perceived.
*[Results for this method can be found here](https://alsven.github.io/reswordvec/)*
 
Details on how I have implemented these methods can be found in the *[Analysis Overview](https://alsven.github.io/methods/)* section of this site.
