The dataset, or corpora, for the project is the publication *Stone: An Illustrated Journal*, a monthly journal of the stone quarrying industry first published by the D.H. Ranck Publishing Co. in Indianapolis, IN. The first issue of the journal was published in May, 1888. In 1898 publication of the journal was transferred to a series of publishers located in New York, NY. The journal continued to be published through the early 1970s. It's byline was "A Journal for Producers, Workers and Users of Stone, Marble and Granite." 

The first article of its first (May, 1888) issue laid out the kind of material that they would publish which remained consistent through the 1920s:

- "Contributions of a reliable and interesting character on technical topics" which range in scope throughout the journal and include wide ranging topics including stone cutting techniques, construction methods, travelogues of stone producing regions around the world, descriptions of specific stone types, and analysis of architectural styles
- "Descriptive matter applying to mechanical devices which have to do with quarrying, cutting, handling and working stone; and articles relating to trade conditions"
- "Designs in any detail of stone working" such as monument designs and decorative cutting patterns
- "News matter which would apply to any branch in our field"
- General correspondence and short news items provided by subscribers published in a monthly "Notes from Quarry and Shop" section
- Reference statistics and stone testing information
- A "Contract News" section with information on upcoming projects that might be looking for stone suppliers
- Current stone price lists

Not mentioned in the official list above, but present in the journal are original short stories and poems along and reviews of recently published books that might be of interest to readers. Each month's issue was also filled with advertisements, mostly for machinery to make the quarrying and stone finishing process easier and faster. Finally each issue included a “for sale/help wanted” section.
 
The journal (with some publication and digitization interruptions) has been digitized by the New York Public Library and is available up until 1922 through [HathiTrust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008616079). HathiTrust has plain text versions available for Volumes 1, 2, 4-6, 14-19, 24, 26, 28-33, 35-43 covering the years 1888-1922. Most of the missing volumes are unfortunately within the 1890-1910 timeframe. While the issues of Stone from 1922 and earlier are in the public domain, the “digital copy” (the scan and OCR-generated text) is owned by Google and distributed by HathiTrust. Gaining access to the text files involved submitting a formal research proposal to HathiTrust and a legal agreement between my institution (Northeastern University) and Google that the text would be used only for research and not be distributed.
 
The text files for *Stone* are representative of the kind of OCR-produced text that is available for historic journals whether via HathiTrust, Google Books, JSTOR, or other sources.  While the image quality of the scanned PDFs is typically high, the successful conversion from image to readable text in the OCR process is variable. Some sections are relatively clear while others have multiple errors. Mis-spelled and nonsense words are present throughout the text and some sections of some issues are completely unreadable. For the most part, the scanned text in all the issues is readable and there are not too many sections where the OCR process completely failed (note, these are mostly for pages where the image in the PDF is also not clear). A few of the volumes contain repeated sections.
